# How to Run Sample Programs

To run `kineto_playground.cpp` in the `sample_programs` folder, you can use the following steps: (Note: scripts below are hard-coded to a specific set of sample programs, you can modify them to work with a different program. TODO: make these scripts more flexible.)

1. `./build-cu.sh`
    - this generates `kplay-cu.o`
2. `./build.sh`
    - this generates binary called `main`
3. Run `./main`
    - runs your code defined in `kineto_playground.cpp`
